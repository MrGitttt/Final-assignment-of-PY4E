# Final-assignment-of-PY4E

The NBA player data and statistics can be spidered with player_spider.py and stats_spider.py I've done. 
The data spidered from www.balldontlie.io/api/v1 was stored in SQLITE file called NBA_2021-2022.sqlite. 
pline.py and tword.py can be used to generate line graph and word cloud based on the pline.js and tword.js supported by the course.
The final graphs can be seen in pline.htm and tword.htm.
