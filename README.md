The NBA player data and statistics can be spidered with player_spider.py and stats_spider.py I've done. 
The data spidered from www.balldontlie.io/api/v1 was stored in SQLITE file called NBA_2021-2022.sqlite. 
pline.py and tword.py can be used to generate pline.js and tword.js for the input data of visualization.
The line graph and the word cloud can be seen from pline.htm and tword.htm.
